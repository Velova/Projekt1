          Anime is something that I grew up with. When I was younger, my sister
          used to watch quite a bit of anime and would watch some shows with my
          family occasionally. The animes I grew up watching were Naruto,
          Atashin’chi, and Keroro just to name a few. Naturally, I would be
          interested in anime when I grow up. As of writing this, I do not watch
          as much anime as I used to, but it is because I can not find any shows
          that pique my interest and also that I tend to drop animes a lot due
          to the fact that I get bored of them after a while. Nowadays, I
          usually read manga instead, I do not really know why, but I do not get
          bored with mangas as I do with anime.

          My favorite anime by far has to be gundam blood orphans, or <a href="#gundam">Mobile
          Suit Gundam: Iron Blooded-Orphans.</a> The thing I like about it the most
          is that the main character is pretty badass and although quite
          overpowered honestly but also because the anime is more realistic and
          people actually die, unlike other shows. The anime also has great and
          intense fights with much action. There are plenty of things I like
          about the anime and these are just the things popping up on my mind
          right now. Other animes I like a lot are mostly movies, like
          <a href="#kiminonawa">kimi no na wa</a> that you probably have heard
          of despite not knowing anything about anime whatsoever and <a href="#koenokatachi">koe no katachi.</a> I will drop the MAL synopsis below of the mentioned animes
          below. <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/Velova">Link to my MAL</a>

          Over three hundred years have passed since the Calamity War, the great
          conflict between Earth and its outer space colonies. Now Earth is
          ruled over by four economic blocs, and the military organization
          Gjallarhorn is responsible for keeping the peace. Mars, on the other
          hand, depends heavily on Earth's economy. Horrified by the appalling
          living conditions that Mars' inhabitants have to bear, Kudelia Aina
          Bernstein, a young aristocrat from the Chryse Autonomous Region, gets
          involved in the Red Planet's independence movement. She hires the
          services of a local company, Chryse Guard Security (CGS), to escort
          her on the journey to Earth to negotiate economic conditions with the
          earthly bloc that controls the region. The Third Army
          Division—consisting of Mikazuki Augus, Orga Itsuka, and many other
          child soldiers—are chosen to protect her. When Gjallarhorn attacks the
          CGS facilities to assassinate the young revolutionary threatening
          their interests, Orga and his comrades must not let the attackers
          accomplish their goal—in fact, Gjallarhorn's actions might turn out to
          be the unintentional catalyst that leads the children to be the
          forgers of their own destiny.

        <p>
          Mitsuha Miyamizu, a high school girl, yearns to live the life of a boy
          in the bustling city of Tokyo—a dream that stands in stark contrast to
          her present life in the countryside. Meanwhile in the city, Taki
          Tachibana lives a busy life as a high school student while juggling
          his part-time job and hopes for a future in architecture. One day,
          Mitsuha awakens in a room that is not her own and suddenly finds
          herself living the dream life in Tokyo—but in Taki's body! Elsewhere,
          Taki finds himself living Mitsuha's life in the humble countryside. In
          pursuit of an answer to this strange phenomenon, they begin to search
          for one another. Kimi no Na wa. revolves around Mitsuha and Taki's
          actions, which begin to have a dramatic impact on each other's lives,
          weaving them into a fabric held together by fate and circumstance.

        As a wild youth, elementary school student Shouya Ishida sought to beat
        boredom in the cruelest ways. When the deaf Shouko Nishimiya transfers
        into his class, Shouya and the rest of his class thoughtlessly bully her
        for fun. However, when her mother notifies the school, he is singled out
        and blamed for everything done to her. With Shouko transferring out of
        the school, Shouya is left at the mercy of his classmates. He is
        heartlessly ostracized all throughout elementary and middle school,
        while teachers turn a blind eye. Now in his third year of high school,
        Shouya is still plagued by his wrongdoings as a young boy. Sincerely
        regretting his past actions, he sets out on a journey of redemption: to
        meet Shouko once more and make amends. Koe no Katachi tells the
        heartwarming tale of Shouya's reunion with Shouko and his honest
        attempts to redeem himself, all while being continually haunted by the
        shadows of his past.
