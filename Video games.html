          My mostly played video game right now has to be League of legends. As
          of writing this, I have spent about 1900 hours on this game, which is
          a lot. I started playing this in 2016 I believe and have played it
          quite frequently ever since, but I do get pretty mad a this game, so I
          take breaks from it. In League of legends, my most played character is
          Riven, followed by Vayne and Teemo. I am currently platinum rank in
          League of legends, I have wanted to climb the ladder, but I lose
          motivation due to the toxic community and tryharding is pretty tiring.

          Another game I play is minecraft. I do not play it as much nowadays,
          but this was the game I grew up with. However, unlike most kids, I did
          not run around in survival and build dirt houses. Instead, I played
          pvp such as hunger games where the goal is to be the last one alive in
          the game. Before the game started, you could choose different kits
          that give you different perks, also this is not vanilla minecraft,
          some of the differences could for instance be that soups instantly
          give you hp which is probably the most mechanically challenging thing
          about hunger games. There could also appear things called "feasts"
          where you can aqcuire loot in order to more easily defeat other
          players.
